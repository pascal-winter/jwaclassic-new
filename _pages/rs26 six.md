  excerpt: "This is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur d’Automobiles à Lyon ».<br>
  The model presented here bears the N°29359. It was coach built in Lyon by Billeter et Cartier as a limousine, with separation, on a lengthened chassis.<br>
  The restoration began in 2011, on a very sound base that had not been previously restored, thus enabling to restore very close to the original. <br>
  In October 2011, the Rochet-Schneider 26-Six N° 29359 took part in the **Deauville Concours d’Elegance** and won the following prizes :<br>
  - The «Volant d’Or»<br>
  - The Best of Show<br>
  - The jury’s’ Grand Prix for the best restoration.<br>

  excerpt: "This is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur
  d’Automobiles à Lyon », and this is not surprising :<br>
  • Double ignition ( by magneto and coil ) which can be used separately or simultaneously<br>
  • Brakes with internal frictions and assistance<br>
  • Lubricating oil purifier with double oil pumps<br>
  • The oil cooler can be disengaged during cold weather<br>
  • Double barrel carburettor with automatic connection at high speeds<br>
  • Centralised greasing by foot pedal<br>
  • An aviation type instrument panel.<br>

  title: ""
  excerpt: "At the 1929 Paris Motor Show, the 26-Six was the most expensive (together with the Hispano–Suiza).<br>
  In “la Vie de l’Automobile”, the columist concluded his presentation as follows:<br>
  <br>
  *“As can be seen, the manufacturers of Lyon wanted their cars to be perfect in all respects, and we have to admit that they have reached their goal.”*<br>
  <br>
  But the industrial crisis put an end to the high hopes of the brand and to the “26-Six” which was the last passenger car made by Rochet-Schneider."

  title: "About the model N°29359"
  excerpt: "This imposing Rochet-Schneider Limousine with divider by Billetier & Cartier was part of the Serge Pozzoli collection in the early 90’s.<br>
  <br>
  The history of this very last automobiles manufactured by Rochet-Schneider was clear, at least we believed so.<br>
  The oral tradition was that Serge Pozzoli acquired it from its first owner, a French lawyer based in Alger by the name of Otto Mantoux, registered at the Alger court house, as testified by the plaque apposed on the back of the Rochet.<br>"

feature_row_history4:

  title: "From Alger to Menton"
  excerpt: "Still, we decided to check things out, just in case. And, surprise ! In August 1930, the first owner was actually an English doctor practicing in Menton.<br>
  <br>
  His name was Stanley Rendall. English obstetric specialist, he chose the south of France more by personal preference rather than purely professional. We found his name on a climatotherapy seminar.
  <br>He moved later on to Aix-les-Bains, still in possession of the Rochet, where he practiced many years in his mansion still in existence and named “Villa Stanley Rendall”.<br>
  <br>
  So the question is : how and when this beautiful Limousine changed hand from Doctor Rendall in Aix-les-Bains to Mr Mantoux, lawyer in Alger?<br>"
