  excerpt: "This is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur d’Automobiles à Lyon ».<br>
  The model presented here bears the N°29359. It was coach built in Lyon by Billeter et Cartier as a limousine, with separation, on a lengthened chassis.<br>
  The restoration began in 2011, on a very sound base that had not been previously restored, thus enabling to restore very close to the original. <br>
  In October 2011, the Rochet-Schneider 26-Six N° 29359 took part in the **Deauville Concours d’Elegance** and won the following prizes :<br>
  - The «Volant d’Or»<br>
  - The Best of Show<br>
  - The jury’s’ Grand Prix for the best restoration.<br>

## About the Rochet-Schneider 26-Six
![image-left](/assets/images/p-rochet-scheider-26-six/history-rochet-schneider-26-six-001.jpg){: .align-left .width-fourty}
At the 1929 Paris Motor Show, the 26-Six was the most expensive (together with the Hispano–Suiza). In “la Vie de l’Automobile”, the columist concluded his presentation as follows:
<blockquote> “As can be seen, the manufacturers of Lyon wanted their cars to be perfect in all respects, and we have to admit that they have reached their goal.”</blockquote>
<br>
**"Beyond all superlatives"** : this is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur
d’Automobiles à Lyon », and this is not surprising :<br>
• Double ignition ( by magneto and coil ) which can be used separately or simultaneously<br>
• Brakes with internal frictions and assistance<br>
• Lubricating oil purifier with double oil pumps<br>
• The oil cooler can be disengaged during cold weather<br>
• Double barrel carburettor with automatic connection at high speeds<br>
• Centralised greasing by foot pedal<br>
• An aviation type instrument panel.<br>
<br>
But the industrial crisis put an end to the high hopes of the brand and to the “26-Six” which was the last passenger car made by Rochet-Schneider.

## About the model N°29359
![image-left](/assets/images/p-rochet-scheider-26-six/history-rochet-schneider-26-six-002.jpg){: .align-left .width-fourty}
This imposing Rochet-Schneider Limousine with divider by Billetier & Cartier was part of the Serge Pozzoli collection in the early 90’s. While mechanically sound, it required a total bodywork restoration initiated in 2011.<br>
<br>
The history of this very last automobiles manufactured by Rochet-Schneider was clear, at least we believed so.<br>
The oral tradition was that Serge Pozzoli acquired it from its first owner, a French lawyer based in Alger by the name of Otto Mantoux, registered at the Alger court house, as testified by the plaque apposed on the back of the Rochet : Maître OTTO MANTOUX, Avocat à la Cour d’Appel d’ALGER, 6 rue JOINVILLE • ALGER<br>
<br>
Still, we decided to check things out, just in case. Ho surprise, the first owner was in August 1930 an English doctor practicing in Menton.<br>
<br>
His name was Stanley Rendall. English by birth, obstetric specialist, he chose the south of France for more personal preference than purely professional. We found his name on a climatotherapy seminar. He moved later on to Aix-les-Bains, still in possession of the Rochet, where he practiced many years in his mansion still in existence and named “Villa Stanley Rendall”.<br>
<br>
So the question is : how and when this beautiful Limousine changed hand from Doctor Rendall in Aix-les-Bains to Mr Mantoux, lawyer in Alger?
