  excerpt: "This is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur d’Automobiles à Lyon ».<br>
  The model presented here bears the N°29359. It was coach built in Lyon by Billeter et Cartier as a limousine, with separation, on a lengthened chassis.<br>
  The restoration began in 2011, on a very sound base that had not been previously restored, thus enabling to restore very close to the original. <br>
  In October 2011, the Rochet-Schneider 26-Six N° 29359 took part in the **Deauville Concours d’Elegance** and won the following prizes :<br>
  - The «Volant d’Or»<br>
  - The Best of Show<br>
  - The jury’s’ Grand Prix for the best restoration.<br>

# History
## "The Rochet-Schneider 26-Six : « beyond all superlatives»"
![image-left](/assets/images/p-rochet-scheider-26-six/history-rochet-schneider-26-six-003.jpg){: .align-left}
This is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur  d’Automobiles à Lyon », and this is not surprising :<br>
  • Double ignition ( by magneto and coil ) which can be used separately or simultaneously<br>
  • Brakes with internal frictions and assistance<br>
  • Lubricating oil purifier with double oil pumps<br>
  • The oil cooler can be disengaged during cold weather<br>
  • Double barrel carburettor with automatic connection at high speeds<br>
  • Centralised greasing by foot pedal<br>
  • An aviation type instrument panel.<br>
<br>  
<br>

At the 1929 Paris Motor Show, the 26-Six was the most expensive (together with the Hispano–Suiza).<br>
In “la Vie de l’Automobile”, the columist concluded his presentation as follows:<br>
<blockquote>
“As can be seen, the manufacturers of Lyon wanted their cars to be perfect in all respects, and we have to admit that they have reached their goal.”</blockquote>
But the industrial crisis put an end to the high hopes of the brand and to the “26-Six” which was the last passenger car made by Rochet-Schneider."

## The Rochet-Schneider 26-six N°29359 : from Alger to Menton
![image-left](/assets/images/p-rochet-scheider-26-six/history-rochet-schneider-26-six-002.jpg){: .align-left}
This imposing Rochet-Schneider Limousine with divider by Billetier & Cartier was part of the Serge Pozzoli collection in the early 90’s.<br>
<br>
The history of this very last automobiles manufactured by Rochet-Schneider was clear, at least we believed so.<br>
The oral tradition was that Serge Pozzoli acquired it from its first owner, a French lawyer based in Alger by the name of Otto Mantoux, registered at the Alger court house, as testified by the plaque apposed on the back of the Rochet.<br>
<br>
Still, we decided to check things out, just in case. And, surprise ! In August 1930, the first owner was actually an English doctor practicing in Menton.<br>
<br>
His name was Stanley Rendall. Obstetric specialist, he chose the south of France by personal preference. We found his name on a climatotherapy seminar.
<br>He moved later on to Aix-les-Bains, still in possession of the Rochet, where he practiced many years in his mansion named “Villa Stanley Rendall" and still in existence.<br>
<br>
So the question is : how and when this beautiful Limousine changed hand from Doctor Rendall in Aix-les-Bains to Mr Mantoux, lawyer in Alger?<br>
